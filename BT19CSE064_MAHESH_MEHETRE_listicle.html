                <p class="P4">A computer lab is a space which provides computer services to a defined community. In 
                    VNIT,  we have two computer labs for benefit of students. 
                    Computer labs are typically provided by libraries to the academic institutions to students 
                    who attend the institution, or by other institutions to the public or to people 
                    affiliated with that institution.These labs are opened 24x7 for the students so that everyone can use 
                    the labs according to their time convenience. Students/Users typically must follow a certain user policy to retain 
                    access to the computers. This generally consists of the user not engaging in illegal activities 
                    or attempting to circumvent any security or content-control software while using the computers. 
                    In public settings, computer lab users are often subject to time limits, in order to allow more people 
                    a chance to use the lab, whereas in other institutions, computer access typically requires valid personal 
                    login credentials, which may also allow the institution to track the user's activities. Computers in 
                    computer labs are typically equipped with internet access, while scanners and printers may augment the lab setup. 
                    Computers in computer labs are typically arranged either in rows, so that every workstation has a 
                    similar view of one end of the room to facilitate lecturing or presentations,[2] or in clusters, 
                    to facilitate small group work. In some cases, generally in academic institutions, student laptops or 
                    laptop carts take the place of dedicated computer labs, although computer labs still have a place 
                    in applications requiring special software or hardware not practically implementable in personal computers
                    Lab for every student or working employee of college.

                <p class="P4">CAD means Computer Aided Design or Drafting. Auto cad is most widely used
                    software developed by auto desk. In our college we have a  well working cad lab for benefits of students
                    We work with the IIT Bombay to give students a futuristic and up to date knowlwdge and Auto cad is a drafting package in almost all
                    engineering branches. There are drafting packages like cad are DIAP, CAMD, and
                    Delights. Auto cad is one of the most popular cad packages. It is a general purpose
                    computer aided design. We can draw geometrical entries like plan, section and
                    elevation of a building. We can make accurate and precise drawings like plan, section and elevation
                    of a building. It Improves engineering productively.
                    It Reduces engineering personal requirement.
                    and Drawings prepared in the software can be stored safely</p>

                <p class="P4">The RS and GIS that is Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System Lab was established within
                    department of Civil Engineering in 1998 by Dr. Yashwant B Katpatal. The objective of
                    establishing lab within the department was to provide exposure of this important
                    technology to students of Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Water Resources
                    Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Engineering Geology. The area of
                    Geoinformatics finds its application in variety of projects for information extraction and
                    management. Since its inception, the lab has been catering to the students research in
                    different studies for their Graduate, Post Graduate and Doctoral thesis. The Lab is also
                    equipped for providing Consultancy in the area of Remote Sensing and GIS applications and
                    several consultancy projects have been completed.</p>
